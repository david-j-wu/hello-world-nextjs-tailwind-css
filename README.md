# Hello, World! with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

This is the source code for the tutorial written by David Wu to build the Hello, World! with Next.js and Tailwind CSS project: Setting up a “Hello, World!” web app with Next.js and Tailwind CSS ([https://davidwu.io/posts/setting-up-a-hello-world-web-app-with-nextjs-and-tailwind-css/](https://davidwu.io/posts/setting-up-a-hello-world-web-app-with-nextjs-and-tailwind-css/)).

The terminal commands below are for Mac and other Linux-based systems. Your mileage may vary if you are using Windows or another operating system.

This project uses the MIT License. See `LICENSE.md` for more information.

## Pre-requisites

This project requires Node.js 16.8.0 or higher.

For information on how to download, install and update Node.js, see their official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

You can run the terminal commands `node -v` and `npm -v` to check what versions you have installed of Node.js and the associated package manager NPM.

## How to launch the web app locally

1. Change the present working directory to the `hello-world-next-js-tailwind-css` folder. If you're using Visual Studio Code ([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), then create a new window and open the folder. Alternatively, you can use the `cd` terminal command to do this. You can run the command `pwd` to check you have done this correctly.

2. Install the dependencies for the web app:

```
npm install
```

3. Run the local development server:

```
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser of choice and head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the web app live locally.

5. Make desired changes to the web app. Next.js will automatically update the web app when you save changes to the source code.
